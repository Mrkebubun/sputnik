# Sputnik Protocol Documentation

## Overview

The server and client communicate using [â€‹WAMP] (http://wamp.ws/).
This is a derivative of a websocket connection with an additional layer supporting RPC and PubSub.

The default port for websockets is 8000. A typical session runs as follows:

1. The client initiates a connection to the server.
2. The client is not authenticated, so they can only query public data, and subscribe to public feeds.
3. The client authenticates to the server via challenge response.
4. The client is now authenticated and may make private calls.
5. The client is automatically subscribed to several feeds relating to their account.

## RPC Response Format

RPC responses are tuples of two elements. The first element any non-zero value if the RPC call succeeded. It is zero
otherwise. The second element is call specific.

## Denominations

All prices and quantities are stored as integers and transmitted over the network as integers. Read
the denominations specification: https://github.com/MimeticMarkets/sputnik/blob/master/clients/Denominations.md

## Data formats

Certain objects are send to the client. They contain a subset of the information contained in the
corresponding server objects. Each is encoded in JSON.
