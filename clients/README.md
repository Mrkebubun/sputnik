# Sputnik Protocol Documentation

## Overview

The server and client communicate using [â€‹WAMPv2] (http://wamp.ws/).
This is a derivative of a websocket connection with an additional layer supporting RPC and PubSub.

The default port for websockets is 8443. A typical session runs as follows:

1. The client initiates a connection to the server.
2. The client is not authenticated, so they can only query public data, and subscribe to public feeds.
3. The client authenticates to the server via challenge response.
4. The client is now authenticated and may make private calls.
5. The client is automatically subscribed to several feeds relating to their account.

The websockets endpoint is:

wss://hostname:8443/ws

For information on the REST api, see REST.md

## RPC Response Format

RPC responses are json objects with two elements. In the case of a successful call:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "result": {}
}
```

In the case of a failure

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": ["error-message", "arguments"]
}
```

Error is a list where the first argument is a string specifying the error. Subsequent elements are particular
details about that specific error, for example the invalid data passed to the function.

## Denominations

All prices and quantities are stored as integers and transmitted over the network as integers. Read
the denominations specification: https://github.com/MimeticMarkets/sputnik/blob/master/clients/Denominations.md

## Data formats

Certain objects are send to the client. They contain a subset of the information contained in the
corresponding server objects. Each is encoded in JSON.
