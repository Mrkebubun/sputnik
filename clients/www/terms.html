	<strong>Confirmation</strong>
</p>
<p>
	If the Services execute your trade, a confirmation will be made available electronically via the Services, detailing the particulars of the trade. You
	acknowledge and agree that failure to provide such confirmation shall not make such trade invalid or prejudiced.
</p>
<p>

	us within twenty-four (24) hours.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>8. RISK DISCLOSURE<u></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><u></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>8.1 Internet Transmission Risks </strong>
</p>
<p>
	By using any portion of the Services, you agree that you have considered the risks associated with using an Internet-based trading system, which include
	but are not limited to the failure of hardware, software, and Internet connections. You agree that Service Providers shall not be responsible for any
	communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions, or delays you may experience when trading via the Services, regardless of the cause.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>8.2 Trading Risks</strong>
</p>
<p>
	You agree that you use the Services at your own risk. There are significant risks of loss in trading Digital Assets, Legal Tender, and Derivative
	Contracts. These losses may be substantial. You agree that you have carefully considered whether such trading is suitable for you given your circumstances
	and financial resources. In particular, you should be aware of the following:
</p>
<p>
	(a) Under certain market conditions, it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur if the market reaches a daily price
	fluctuation limit ("limit move"), or if there is insufficient liquidity in the market.
</p>
<p>
	(b) You may lose all the Funds in your Sputnik Account, and in some cases you may incur losses beyond such Funds and be required to remit additional funds
	to us. If the market moves against your position, you may be required to provide a substantial amount of additional margin Funds, on short notice, to
	maintain your position. If you do not provide the required Funds, your position may be liquidated at a loss, and you will be liable for any resulting
	deficit balance in your Sputnik Account.
</p>
<p>
	(c) All derivative positions involve risk, and a "spread" position may not be less risky than an outright "long" or "short" position.
</p>
<p>
	(d) Leverage can work against you and can lead to large losses.
</p>
<p>
	You acknowledge and agree that Service Providers are not your broker, intermediary, agent, or advisor in any fiduciary capacity. Any communication you
	receive from Service Providers does not constitute advice and shall not be construed as such.
</p>
<p>
	TRADING INVOLVES MANY RISKS. THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TRADING USING THESE SERVICES. YOU ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY
	FOR ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TRADING.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>9. EXECUTION OF TRADES<u></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><u></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
	When using Sputnik to trade Digital Assets and fiat currency in accordance with these Terms, you authorize us to execute the transaction and agree to pay
	any applicable Fees. When placing an order via the Services, you may only cancel an order placed if such cancellation occurs before we fill the
	transaction. <u>Once an order has been filled, you may not cancel, withdraw or change your authorization for us to complete such orders.</u> If the order
	was partially filled, the unfilled portion may be canceled. <u>All trades are irreversible once filled</u>. We may, at our sole discretion, reverse a trade
	under certain extraordinary circumstances or when required by law, but you may not request a reversal of a trade.
</p>
<p>
	If you have an insufficient amount of Funds in your Sputnik Account to complete an order via the Services, we may, in our sole discretion, cancel the
	entire order or fulfill a portion of that order using the Funds currently available in your Sputnik Account, less any Fees owed in connection with the
	execution of the trade.
</p>
<p>
	We may, in our sole discretion, and at any time, refuse any trade submitted via the Services, impose limits on the amount traded via the Services, or
	impose other conditions or restrictions upon the Services without prior notice. For example, we may limit the number of open orders that you may establish
	via the Services, or we may limit the rate at which orders can be created and canceled.

	Some jurisdictions do not allow for the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so some or all of the above limitations or
	exclusions may not apply to you.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>15. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><u></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Except to the extent required by applicable law and then only to that extent, in no event will Service Providers, or their respective employees, officers,
	directors, affiliates, or agents be liable to you on any legal theory for any incidental, direct, indirect, punitive, actual, consequential, special,
	exemplary or other damages, including without limitation, loss of revenue or income, lost profits, pain and suffering, emotional distress, cost of
	substitute goods or services, or similar damages suffered or incurred by you or any third party that arise in connection with the Services, even if Service
	Providers have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
</p>
<p>
	Service Providers shall not be responsible or liable whatsoever in any matter for any content posted on the websites or Services, including claims of
	infringement relating to content posted on the Services, for your use of the Services or for the conduct of third parties in connection with the Services.
</p>
<p>
	To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall the aggregate liability of Service Providers (including their respective directors, members,
	employees, and agents) whether in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence, whether active, passive, or implied) product liability, strict liability,
	or other theory, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the Services, exceed the fees paid by you to us during the twelve (12)
	months immediately preceding the date of any claim giving rise to such liability.
</p>
<p>
	Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, or the exclusion of certain warranties. Therefore some
	of the limitations described herein may not apply to you.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>16. INDEMNIFICATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><u></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
	You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Service Providers (and each of their respective officers, directors, members, employees, agents, and
	affiliates) from any claim, demand, action, damage, loss, cost, or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees, arising out or
	relating to (a) your use of, or conduct in connection with, our Services; (b) any Feedback you provide; (c) your violation of these Terms; or (d) your
	violation of any rights of any other person or entity. If you are obligated to indemnify Service Providers, Service Providers will have the right, in their
	sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding (at our expense) and determine whether they wish to settle it.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>17. GOVERNING LAW </strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	These Terms and all aspects of the relationship between you and us shall be construed and enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of
	[JURISDICTION] without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The courts in some countries may not apply the laws of [JURISDICTION] to some types of
	disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where [JURISDICTION] law is excluded from applying, your country's laws will apply to such disputes
	related to these Terms.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>18. ENTIRE AGREEMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><u></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
	These Terms, any Modified Terms, and any other conditions or policies referred to and incorporated herein shall constitute the entire agreement between us
	and you regarding the Services. These Terms do not alter the terms or conditions of any other electronic or written agreement you may have with us for the
	Services or for any other product or service or otherwise. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with us,
	the terms of that other agreement will control only if these Terms are specifically identified and declared to be overridden by such other agreement.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>19. SEVERABILITY</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><u></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
	If any provision of these Terms is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall
	continue in full force and effect.
</p>
<p>
	<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>20. WAIVER</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<u></u>
</p>
<p>
	Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver thereof.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>21. FORCE MAJEURE</strong>
</p>
<p>
	We shall not be liable for any inaccuracy, error, delay in, or omission of (i) any information, or (ii) the transmission or delivery of information, or any
	loss or damage, arising from any event beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or
	other act of god, fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of government, communications, power failure, or equipment or software
	malfunction (each a "<u>Force Majeure Event</u>").
</p>
<p>
	<strong>22. ASSIGNMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>
	You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign or transfer any or all of our
	rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, without obtaining your consent or approval.

	<strong>MARGIN DISCLOSURE STATEMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>
	This document includes basic facts about purchasing digital assets, derivative contracts, or legal tender on margin, and information about risks associated
	with trading with margin. Review this statement before trading any margin assets. Please contact support at [SUPPORT EMAIL] if you have any questions or
	concerns about margin trading.
</p>
<p>
	When you place trades for futures contracts, or sell a prediction contract, you do not pay or receive cash when the trade takes place. Your cash flow may
	occur when you close out the position, or when the contract marks to market. In order to ensure that you will have enough cash to make all necessary
	payments, you will be required to keep a margin balance on hand. If your assets decline in value, your margin requirement may increase past your available
	cash, and as a result we will take action, such as issue a margin call and/or close out your positions, in order to maintain the required equity in your
	account.
</p>
<p>
	It is important to fully understand the risks involved in trading with margin. These risks include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>You can lose more funds than you deposit</strong>
		. If the assets you hold decline in value you may be required to provide additional funds in order to avoid the forced sale of the assets in your
		account.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>We can force the sale of assets in your account</strong>
		. If your account balance falls below our maintenance margin requirements, we will close your positions to cover the margin deficiency. These positions
		will be closed quickly and may not receive optimal pricing if the market is not liquid. You will be responsible for any shortfall that remains after
		your positions are closed out.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>We can sell your assets without contacting you</strong>
		. We do not need to contact you for a margin call to be valid. Although we will make an effort to contact you in the event of a margin call, we are not
		required to. Therefore whether or not we have contacted you, we may close out your permissions without your consent.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>We can increase margin requirements at any time and are not required to provide you with advance written notice</strong>
		. Markets are often volatile and sometimes require the immediate increase of margin requirements. Such an increase may result in an immediate margin
		call. Your failure to satisfy the call may result in the liquidation of your account. We are not responsible to delays in the release of funds intended
		to satisfy the call.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call</strong>
		. While we may sometimes offer an extension under certain circumstances, you do not have the right to one.
	</li>
</ul>
